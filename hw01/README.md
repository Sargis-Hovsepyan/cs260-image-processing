## Assignment 01

### Task 0

Compute a value n = (length of your first name) + (length of your last name) + \
(difference between the first letter of your last name and the capital letter ‘A’)

Compute the index of your individual dataset rounded to the nearest integer \
id = round(–0.00165 * n^3 + 0.12384 * n^2 – 2.33779 * n + 14.1165)

Computation given below:
```

name: Sargis        surname: Hovsepyan

n = 6 + 9 + 7 = 22

id = round(–0.00165 * 22^3 + 0.12384 * 22^2 – 2.33779 * 22 + 14.1165) = round(5.05448) = 5

```

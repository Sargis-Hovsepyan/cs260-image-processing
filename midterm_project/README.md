# Midterm Project

The course project is part of a larger project that aims to predict student progress in CS and IT
disciplines based on their handwriting samples. It is expected to apply in its framework several Image
Processing methods to identify and extract graphical features that could be used in the subsequent studies.
Several Project stages are outlined below. After Stage 0, the stages can be addressed and implemented in an
arbitrary order. Depending on the progress, additional or modified stages may also be posted. You are
welcome to import and use OCR methods after proper acknowledgment and a brief description.

## Stage 0: Store the images

Created a new folder, cs_handwriting. Hard copies of handwriting samples were scanned with a phone and uploaded in 
cs_handwriting with an individual code on each page. The code format is CRS.TST.ddmmyy.Cxxx (course name, test, date, 
lookup index â€“ a letter H, M, or L followed by three digits). Created subfolders for each Cxxx and saved in them the images 
of all pages with such Cxxx. Named the files after the code specifying the page number as a suffix after the underscore,
like CRS.TST.ddmmyy.Cxxx_p1.jpg.

## Stage 1: Eliminate the printed text and preprocess

The cropped versions of each page are uploaded in the cs_handwriting_croped folder in the appropriate subfolder. The cropped
versions contain only the code fragments. The pages that had almost no handwriting on them were omitted. The cropping was 
achieved with Photoshop. After cropping, the pictures were fine-tuned with Gaussian blur, an increase in contrast and brightness, 
and additional noise was omitted. The refined versions are binarised and uploaded in cs_handwriting_bin for later processing.
The refined versions were created with the help of the tune.py script. As long as it is running, it updates the cs_handwriting_bin.
Settings of tunning can be adjusted from tune.py

The remove_printed_text is a script that does what is described above. Due to low-quality pictures, it was better to remove
the printed text with Photoshop. The script is valid and can be applied to scanned images with very high quality.
